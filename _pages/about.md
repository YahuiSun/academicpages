# Career Profile

Motivated by China's first crewed space mission in 2003, I studied aerospace engineering for my bachelor (2008-2012) and master (2012-2014) degrees in the Harbin Institute of Technology, China.  Subsequently, I studied Steiner tree problems in graphs for my PhD (2014-2018) in the University of Melbourne, Australia. 

I'm currently a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
